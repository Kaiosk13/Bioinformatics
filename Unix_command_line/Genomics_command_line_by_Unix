1. How many chromosomes are there in the genome?
grep -c ">" apple.genome
## 3
# A fasta file contains a line started with ‘>’ followed by informations/identifier of the sequence of nucleotides. 
# In order to know how many chromosomes, we can count the number of ‘>’ in the file.
# -c(count): 只印出含有特定文字行的次數

2. How many genes?
cut -f1 apple.genes | sort -u | wc -l
cut -f1 apple.genes | uniq | wc -l
## 5453
# In the first column(f1) we have the name of the genes. Filter the unique values, because one gene may have more than one transcript. Then we count it(wc -l).
# -l: 在找到特定字元時只印出一次檔名（不印出該行，且不會每次都印出）
# -u: sorting in unique like the command uniq

3. How many transcript variants?
cut -f2 apple.genes | sort -u | wc -l
## 5456
# transcript in second column(-f2)

4. How many genes have a single splice variant?
cut -f1 apple.genes | uniq -c | grep " 1 " | wc -l
cut -f1 apple.genes | uniq -c | grep -c " 1 "
## 5450
# -c: count the number occurs in 1 time (grep'1')

5. How may genes have 2 or more splice variants?
cut -f1 apple.genes | uniq -c | grep -v " 1 " | wc -l
## 3
# -v: withou"1", which mean 2 or more than 2

6. How many genes are there on the ‘+’ strand?
cut -f1,4 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep "+" | wc -l
## 2662
# -f1,4: column1 to 4, colum4 is +/-; if + then column 1 will be count

7. How many genes are there on the ‘-’ strand?
cut -f1,4 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep "-" | wc -l
## 2791

8. How many genes are there on chromosome chr1?
9. How many genes are there on each chromosome chr2?
10. How many genes are there on each chromosome chr3?
cut -f1,3 apple.genes | sort -u | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c
cut -f1,3 apple.genes | uniq | grep "chr1" | wc -l
## 1624 chr1
## 2058 chr2
## 1771 chr3

11. How many transcripts are there on chr1?
12. How many transcripts are there on chr2?
13. How many transcripts are there on chr3?
cut -f2,3 apple.genes | sort -u | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c
## 1625 chr1
## 2059 chr2
## 1772 chr3

14. How many genes are in common between condition A and condition B?
cut -f1 apple.conditionA | sort -u > sortA
cut -f1 apple.conditionB | sort -u > sortB
comm -1 -2 sortA sortB | wc -l
## 2410
# select the first column of the both files and store in new files to make the comparison.
# only show the 3rd column of the output because it shows lines present in both files.

15. How many genes are specific to condition A?
comm -2 -3 sortA sortB | wc -l
##     1205
# only show the first column of the output. It shows the genes exclusive in the first file.

16. How many genes are specific to condition B?
comm -1 -3 sortA sortB | wc -l
##     1243
# only the second column of the output. It shows the genes exclusive in the second file.

17. How many genes are in common to all three conditions?
cut -f1 apple.conditionC | sort -u > sortC
comm -1 -2 sortA sortB > AB_common
comm -1 -2 AB_common sortC | wc -l
## 1608
# need to compare a pair of conditions, than select what they have in common and compare to the third condition.

1. How many sequences were in the genome?
cat wu_0.v7.fas | grep ">" | wc -l
## 7

2. What was the name of the third sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the “>” sign.
3. What was the name of the last sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the “>” sign.
cat wu_0.v7.fas | grep ">"
## >Chr1
## >Chr2
## >Chr3 or grep "^>" wu_0.v7.fas | head -3 | tail -1
## >Chr4
## >Chr5
## >chloroplast
## >mitochondria or grep "^>" wu_0.v7.fas | tail -1

4. How many index files did the operation create?
mkdir wu_0
bowtie2-build wu_0.v7.fas /media/sf_gencommand_proj3_data/wu_0/wu_0 
bowtie2-build >& bowtie2-build.log
ls wu_0/ 
## 6

5. What is the 3-character extension for the index files created?
ls wu_0/ 
## bt2
## List the files in the index directory and observe their extension (n.b., all index files have the extension ‘bt2’)

6. How many reads were in the original fastq file?
bowtie2 -p 4 -x wu_0/wu_0 wu_0_A_wgs.fastq -S wu_0.bt2.sam
147354 reads; of these:
  147354 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    9636 (6.54%) aligned 0 times
    93780 (63.64%) aligned exactly 1 time
    43938 (29.82%) aligned >1 times
93.46% overall alignment rate
## 147354

7. How many matches (alignments) were reported for the original (full-match) setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
## 137719

9. How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 7?
## 137719

11. How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 7? You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.
## 43939

8. How many matches (alignments) were reported with the local-match setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
bowtie2 -p 4 --local -x wu_0/wu_0 wu_0_A_wgs.fastq -S wu_0.bt2.local.sam
147354 reads; of these:
  147354 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:

## 141044

10. How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 8?
## 141044

12. How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 8? Use the format above. You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.

16. How many entries have ‘A’ as the corresponding genome letter?
cat wu_0.vcf | cut -f4 | awk '$1 == "A"' | wc -l
## 1150985

17. How many entries have exactly 20 supporting reads (read depth)?
cat wu_0.vcf | cut -f8 | grep "DP=20" | wc -l
## 1816

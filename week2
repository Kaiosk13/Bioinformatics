For this project, it is recommended that you use the  virtual environment provided with the Course package and the tools therein. 
You may also use your own system and software, however make sure that appropriate versions are installed. The answers are compatible with the following versions of the software: samtools v.1.2, bedtools v.2.24.0. 

As part of a larger project cataloging genetic variation in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, you sequenced and assembled the genome of one strain (‘wu_0_A’), then mapped back the reads to the assembled genome. 
The resulting BAM file is included in the package ‘gencommand_proj2_data.tar.gz’. Using SAMtools and BEDtools as well as other Unix commands introduced in this course, examine the files and answer the following questions. 
NOTE: Input data have been obtained and modified from those generated by the 1001 Genomes Project, accession ‘Wu_0_A’. 

1. How many alignments does the set contain?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f3 | grep –v ’*’ | wc -l
## 221372
# if the file was created with a tool that includes unmapped reads into the BAM file, we would need to exclude the lines representing unmapped reads, i.e. with a ‘*’ in column 3 (chrom):

2. How many alignments show the read's mate unmapped?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f7 | grep –c ‘*’
## 65521 
# An alignment with an unmapped mate is marked with a  ‘*’ in column 7. Note that the question asks for alignments, not reads, so we simply count the number of lines in the SAM file with a ‘*’ in column 7

3. How many alignments contain a deletion (D)?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f6 | grep –c ‘D’
## 2451
# Deletions are be marked with the letter ‘D’ in the CIGAR string for the alignment, shown in column 6

4. How many alignments show the read's mate mapped to the same chromosome?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f7 | grep –c ‘=’
## 150913
# Alignments with the read’s mate mapped to the same chromosome are marked with a ‘=’ in column 7:

5. How many alignments are spliced?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f6 | grep –c ‘N’
## 0
# A spliced alignment will be marked with an ‘N’ (intron gap) in the CIGAR field:

6. How many alignments does the set contain?
samtools sort athal_wu_0_A.bam athal_wu_0_A.sorted
samtools index athal_wu_0_A.sorted.bam
samtools view –b athal_wu_0_A.sorted.bam “Chr3:11777000-11794000” > athal_wu_0_A.region.bam
samtools flagstat athal_wu_0_A.region.bam
## 7081
# to reduced set, i.e. to extract from the original set only those alignments in the specified region
# create the file ‘athal_wu_0_A.sorted.bam’. We then index this file
# create the index file ‘athal_wu_0_A.sorted.bam.bai’ in the current directory. Lastly, we extract alignments in the specified range:
# The option ‘-b’ will generate output in BAM format. The resulting BAM file will be sorted, so it can be indexed directly if needed.
# Common pitfalls: make sure to specify the correct reference sequence (‘Chr3’, not ‘chr3’) and exclude ‘,’ when representing the query coordinates. 
# Also, make sure to use the sorted and index BAM file. To determine the number of alignments in the new (region) file, we can use the same commands as for Q1, e.g.

7. How many alignments show the read's mate unmapped?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.region.bam | cut –f7 | grep –c ‘*’
## 1983
# same commands as for Q2, but for the new BAM file

8. How many alignments contain a deletion (D)?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.region.bam | cut –f6 | grep –c ‘D’
## 31
# same commands as for Q3, but for the new BAM file:

9. How many alignments show the read's mate mapped to the same chromosome?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f7 | grep –c ‘=’
## 4670
# same commands as for Q4, but for the new BAM file:

Q10. How many alignments are spliced?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut –f6 | grep –c ‘N’
## 0
# same commands as for Q5, but for the new BAM file:

Q11. How many sequences are in the genome file?
samtools view –H athal_wu_0_A.bam | grep –c “SN:”
## 7
# information can be found in the header of the BAM file:

Q12. What is the length of the first file secuence in the genome file?
samtools view –H athal_wu_0_A.bam | grep “SN:” | more
## 29923332
# length information is stored in the header (pattern ‘LN:seq_length’)

Q13. What alignment tool was used?
samtools view –H athal_wu_0_A.bam | grep “^@PG”
## stampy
# program name is listed in the ‘@PG’ line in the BAM header

Q14. What is the read identifier (name) for the first alignment?
## GAii05_0002:1:113:7822:3886#0 ()
# in column 1 of the first alignment record in the SAM file

Q15. What is the start position of this read’s mate on the genome? Give this as ‘chrom:pos’ if the read was mapped, or ‘*” if unmapped.
## Chr3:11700332 ()
# The location of the read’s mate is contained in column 7 (chrom) and column 8 (start position), if the mate is mapped. If the mate is unmapped, it will be marked with a ‘*’ in column 7. 
# To answer the question, we will need to observe these fields in the first SAM record:

Q16. How many overlaps (each overlap is reported on one line) are reported?
bedtools intersect –abam athal_wu_0_A.region.bam –b athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf –bed -wo > overlaps.bed
## 3101 

Q17. How many of these are 10 bases or longer?
cut –f22 overlaps.bed | sort –nrk1 > lengths
## 2899

Q18. How many alignments overlap the annotations?
cut –f1-12 overlaps.bed | sort –u | wc -l
## 3101

Q19. Conversely, how many exons have reads mapped to them?
cut –f13-21 overlaps.bed | sort –u | wc -l
## 21
Q20. If you were to convert the transcript annotations in the file “athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf” into BED format, how many BED records would be generated?
cut –f9 athal_wu_0_A.annot.gtf | cut –d ‘ ‘ –f1,2 | sort –u | wc -l
## 4
